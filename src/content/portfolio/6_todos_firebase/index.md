A todo App, where the user has the ability to Add/Edit/Delete todos. Todos are saved to the Firestore, so the user can basically login anywhere and have access to his todos. The App uses Firebase for the Authentication system, and the user is forced to verify his email before using the App. It's also possible to Re-send the verification email, recover the password and edit the user profile. I made a [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHQvbiQpGC8&list=PLoH-uUW2wEIQU3diUzrpFaFOcXM8z8gBc 'Youtube tutorial of this project') on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8pnh6gmhMP-hyQ6MJb414g 'Fidalgo Youtube Channel') while creating the project.
